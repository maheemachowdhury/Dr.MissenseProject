# Dr.Missense Project

In human protein synthesis, translation is a fundamental step. After a DNA helix has been transcribed into an RNA strand, a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand translates the RNA regions to produce a series of amino acids, making a functional protein. While mRNA is a fantastic translator of RNA, it can only code for amino acidsâ€“it cannot tell if those amino acids will potentially wreck havoc and distort the protein shape and function. Substitution mutations can often replace a base with another base, creating missense phenotypes.

Using these genetic concepts, this interactive and creative game is designed to help users memorize the properties of all 20 amino acids. The user is tested on each amino acid's three-letter abbreviation, one-letter abbreviation, side chain polarity, and molecular structure.
